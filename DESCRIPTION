Package: manynet
Title: Many Ways to Make, Modify, Map, Mark, and Measure Myriad Networks
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2024-10-25
Description: Many tools for making, modifying, mapping, marking, measuring, 
   and motifs and memberships of many different types of networks.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
   The package includes functions for importing and exporting, creating and generating networks,
   modifying networks and node and tie attributes,
   and describing and visualizing networks with sensible defaults.
