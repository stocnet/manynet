Title: Many Ways to Make, Modify, Mark, and Measure Myriad Networks
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 2025-08-22
Description: Many tools for making, modifying, marking, measuring, 
   and motifs and memberships of many different types of networks.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   on directed, multiplex, multimodal, signed, and other networks.
   The package includes functions for importing and exporting, creating and generating networks,
   modifying networks and node and tie attributes,
   and describing networks with sensible defaults.
