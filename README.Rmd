## About the package

While many awesome packages for network analysis exist for R, 
all with their own offerings and advantages, 
they also all have their own vocabulary, syntax, 
and expected formats for data inputs and analytic outputs.
Many of these packages only work on _some_ types of networks
(usually one-mode, simple, directed or undirected networks) for _some_ types of analysis;
if you want to analyse a different type of network or try a different analysis,
a different package is needed.
And they can rely on a very different visual language (and sometimes plotting engine),
which can mess up your pretty presentation or paper.
This can make learning and using network analysis tools in R challenging.

By contrast, `{manynet}` offers _many_ analytic tools that work on _many_ (if not most) types and kinds of networks.
It helps researchers make, modify, mark, measure, and identify nodes' motifs and memberships in networks.
For graph drawing see [`{autograph}`](https://stocnet.github.io/autograph/),
and for further testing and modelling capabilities
see [`{migraph}`](https://stocnet.github.io/migraph/) and the other [stocnet](https://github.com/stocnet) packages.

## Making

Networks can come from many sources and be found in many different formats: 
some can be found in this or other packages, 
some can be created or generated using functions in this package,
and others can be downloaded from the internet and imported from your file system.
`{manynet}` provides tools to make networks from all these sources in any number of common formats.

#### Importing network data

`{manynet}` offers a number of options
for importing network data found in other repositories.
Besides importing and exporting to Excel edgelists, nodelists, and (bi)adjacency matrices,
there are specific routines included for 
[UCINET](http://www.analytictech.com/archive/ucinet.htm), 
[Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/),
and [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) files, e.g.:

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-import-graph-1.png" alt="Graph of manynet input/output formats"/>

```{r import-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=2.5, eval=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
library(ggplot2)
imports <- igraph::graph_from_literal(ucinet:pajek+--+tidygraph,
                                      matrix:dynetml--+tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:nodelist+--+tibble)
imports <- imports %>% mutate(type = ifelse(node_names(imports)%in% c("tidygraph","tibble"), TRUE, FALSE))
graphr(imports, node_size = 4)
```

If you cannot remember the file name/path, then just run `read_*()` with the parentheses empty,
and a file selection popup will open so that you can browse through your file system to find the file.
Usually both `read_*()` and `write_*()` are offered to make sure that `{manynet}` is compatible with your
larger project and analytic workflow.

- `r list_functions("^read_")`
- `r list_functions("^write_")`

#### Identifying network data

There may be no need to import network data though, if that network data already exists in a package in R.
To facilitate testing and to contribute to an ecosystem of easily accessible network data, 
particularly for pedagogical purposes,
we include a number of classical and instructional network datasets,
all thoroughly documented and ready for analysis.
Here are just a few examples, all available in `{manynet}`: 

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-ison_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs illustrating several of the classic networks included in the package"/>

```{r ison_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 250, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, eval=FALSE}
graphr(to_unnamed(ison_karateka)) + ggtitle("Karateka", subtitle = "Zachary 1977") + 
    graphr(ison_algebra, labels = FALSE) + ggtitle("Algebra", subtitle = "McFarland 2001") +
  graphr(to_unnamed(ison_southern_women)) + ggtitle("Southern Women", subtitle = "Davis et al 1941")
#/
  # (graphr(ison_lawfirm) + ggtitle("Law Firm", subtitle = "Lazega 2001") + 
```

Here are some others: `r list_data("^ison_")`

#### Inventing network data

`{manynet}` includes functions for making networks algorithmically.
The `create_*` group of functions create networks with a particular structure,
and will always create the same format from the same inputs,
e.g.:

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-create_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs illustrating the creation of lattices and tree networks"/>

```{r create_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, eval=FALSE}
(graphr(create_lattice(15)) + ggtitle("Lattice", subtitle = "create_lattice(15)") + 
    graphr(create_tree(15)) + ggtitle("Tree", subtitle = "create_tree(15)"))
```

See also `r list_functions("^create_")`.

The `generate_*` group of functions generate networks from
generative mechanisms that may include some random aspect, 
and so will return a different output each time they are run,
e.g.:

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-generate_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs of small-world and scale-free networks of 15 nodes"/>

```{r generate_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, eval=FALSE}
(graphr(generate_smallworld(15)) + ggtitle("Small-World", subtitle = "generate_smallworld(15)") + 
    graphr(generate_scalefree(15)) + ggtitle("Scale-Free", subtitle = "generate_scalefree(15)"))
```

See also `r list_functions("^generate_")`.

Note that all these functions can create directed or undirected,
one-mode or two-mode networks.
Creating two-mode networks is as easy as passing the first argument (`n`)
a vector of two integers instead of one.
For example, while `n = 15` will create a one-mode network of 10 nodes,
whereas `n = c(10,5)` will create a two-mode network of 10 nodes in the first mode,
and 5 nodes in the second mode.
Some of these functions wrap existing algorithms in other packages,
while others are unique offerings or add additional formats,
e.g. two-mode networks.

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-generate_tm-1.png" alt="Graphs of generated one- and two-mode small-world networks"/>

```{r generate_tm, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
graphr(generate_smallworld(15, directed = TRUE), layout = "stress") + ggtitle("Small-World", subtitle = "generate_smallworld(15, directed = TRUE)") + graphr(generate_smallworld(c(10,5)), layout = "stress") + ggtitle("Small-World", subtitle = "generate_smallworld(c(10,5))")
```

#### Inventing data on networks

Lastly, `{manynet}` also includes functions for simulating diffusion
or learning processes over a given network:

- `r list_functions("^play_")`

The diffusion models include not only SI and threshold models,
but also SIS, SIR, SIRS, SEIR, and SEIRS.

## Modifying

Before or during analysis, you may need to modify the network you are analysing in various ways.
Different packages have different syntaxes and vocabulary for such actions;
`{manynet}`'s `to_*()` functions can be used on any class object 
to reformat, transform, or split networks into networks with other properties.

#### Translating network data

Once you have imported network data, 
identified network data in this or other packages in R,
or invented your own,
you may need to translate this data into another class for analysis.
`{manynet}`'s `as_*()` functions can be used to coerce objects 
from one of many common classes into any other.
Below is a directed graph showing the currently available options:

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-coercion-graph-1.png" alt="Graph of coercible relationships between classes"/>

```{r coercion-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, eval=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
graphr(igraph::graph_from_literal(edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph+--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph--+graphAM,
                                      tidygraph:igraph--+siena,
                                      diff_model--+tidygraph:igraph:matrix:diffnet,
                                  diffnet--+igraph:network:diff_model:tidygraph,
                                      siena:goldfish--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph:graphAM),
           "circle", node_size = 3)
ggsave("~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Sites/jameshollway.com/content/post/manynet/README-coercion-graph-1.png")
```

These functions are designed to be as intuitive and lossless as possible,
outperforming many other class-coercion packages.

We use these functions internally in every `{manynet}` and `{migraph}` function to 
(1) allow them to be run on any compatible network format
and (2) use the most efficient algorithm available.
This makes `{manynet}` and `{migraph}` compatible with your existing workflow,
whether you use base R matrices or edgelists as data frames, 
[`{igraph}`](https://igraph.org/r/),
[`{network}`](https://statnet.org), or 
[`{tidygraph}`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html),
and extensible by developments in those other packages too.

### Reformatting

Reformatting means changing the format of the network,
e.g. from directed to undirected via `to_undirected()`.

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-directed_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs illustrating modification of a network's directedness"/>

```{r directed_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
graphr(to_directed(ison_brandes)) + ggtitle("Directed", subtitle = "to_directed(ison_brandes)") + 
    graphr(to_undirected(ison_brandes)) + ggtitle("Undirected", subtitle = "to_undirected(ison_brandes)")
```

### Transforming

Transforming means changing the dimensions of the network,
e.g. from a two-mode network to a one-mode projection via `to_mode1()`.

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-projection_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs illustrating decomposition of a two-mode network into its projections"/>

```{r projection_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
graphr(ison_southern_women, layout = "stress") + ggtitle("Original", subtitle = "ison_southern_women") + 
    graphr(to_mode1(ison_southern_women)) + ggtitle("Row Projection", subtitle = "to_mode1(ison_southern_women)") + 
    graphr(to_mode2(ison_southern_women)) + ggtitle("Column Projection", subtitle = "to_mode2(ison_southern_women)") & 
  ggplot2::theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))
```

### Splitting and Joining

Splitting means separating a network,
e.g. from a whole network to the various ego networks via `to_egos()`.

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-splitting_egs-1.png" alt="Graphs illustrating decomposition of a network into egonets"/>

```{r splitting_egs, echo = FALSE, dpi = 250, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
graphr(ison_adolescents) + ggtitle("Original", subtitle = "ison_adolescents") + 
    graphs(lapply(to_egos(ison_adolescents), to_unnamed)) + ggtitle("Ego Splitting", subtitle = "to_egos(ison_adolescents)")
```

Those functions that split a network into a list of networks are
distinguishable as those `to_*()` functions that are named in the plural.
Split data can be rejoined using the `from_*()` family of functions.

See also `r list_functions("^to_")` and `r list_functions("^from_")`.

## Marking

`{manynet}` includes four special groups of functions, 
each with their own pretty `print()` and `plot()` methods:
marks, measures, motifs, and memberships.
Marks are logical scalars or vectors, measures are numeric, 
memberships categorical, and motifs result in tabular outputs.

`{manynet}`'s `*is_*()` functions offer fast logical tests of various properties.
Whereas `is_*()` returns a single logical value for the network,
`node_is_*()` returns a logical vector the length of the number of nodes in the network,
and `tie_is_*()` returns a logical vector the length of the number of ties in the network.

- `r list_functions("^is_")`
- `r list_functions("^node_is_")`
- `r list_functions("^tie_is_")`

The `*is_max()` and `*is_min()` functions are used to identify
the maximum or minimum, respectively, node or tie according to some measure (see below).

## Motifs

`{manynet}`'s `*by_*()` functions tabulate nodes' frequency in various motifs.
These include:

- `r list_functions("_by_")`

## Memberships

`{manynet}`'s `*in_*()` functions identify nodes' membership in some grouping,
such as a community or component.
These functions always return a character vector, 
indicating e.g. that the first node is a member of group "A", the second in group "B", etc.

- `r list_functions("_in_")`

For example `node_brokerage_census()` returns 
the frequency of nodes' participation in 
Gould-Fernandez brokerage roles for a one-mode network,
and the Jasny-Lubell brokerage roles for a two-mode network.

These can be analysed alone, or used as a profile for establishing equivalence.
`{manynet}` offers both HCA and CONCOR algorithms,
as well as elbow, silhouette, and strict methods for _k_-cluster selection.

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/migraph/dendroPlot.png" alt="Plot of a dendrogram of structural equivalence"/>

`{manynet}` also includes functions for establishing membership on other bases,
such as typical community detection algorithms, 
as well as component and core-periphery partitioning algorithms.

## Measuring

`{manynet}` also offers a large and growing smorgasbord of measures that
can be used at the node, tie, and network level 
to measure some feature, property, or quantity of the network.
Each recognises whether the network is directed or undirected,
weighted or unweighted, one-mode or two-mode.
All return normalized values wherever possible,
though this can be overrided.
Here are some examples:

- _Centrality_: `node_degree()`, `node_closeness()`, `node_betweenness()`, and `node_eigenvector()`,
  `net_degree()`, `net_closeness()`, `net_betweenness()`, and `net_eigenvector()`
- _Cohesion_: `net_density()`, `net_reciprocity()`, `net_transitivity()`, `net_equivalency()`, and `net_congruency()`
- _Hierarchy_: `net_connectedness()`, `net_efficiency()`, `net_upperbound()`
- _Resilience_: `net_components()`, `net_cohesion()`, `net_adhesion()`, `net_diameter()`, `net_length()`
- _Innovation_: e.g. `node_redundancy()`, `node_effsize()`, `node_efficiency()`, `node_constraint()`, `node_hierarchy()`
- _Diversity_: `net_richness()`, `net_diversity()`, `net_heterophily()`, `net_assortativity()`, 
  `node_richness()`, `node_diversity()`, `node_heterophily()`, `node_assortativity()`
- _Topology_: e.g. `net_core()`, `net_factions()`, `net_modularity()`, `net_smallworld()`, `net_balance()`
- _Diffusion_: e.g. `net_reproduction()`, `net_immunity()`, `node_thresholds()`

There is a lot here, 
so we recommend you explore [the list of functions](https://stocnet.github.io/migraph/reference/index.html) to find out more.

## Tutorials

This package includes tutorials to help new and experienced users
learn how they can conduct social network analysis using the package.
These tutorials leverage the additional package `{learnr}` (see [here](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/)),
but we have made it easy to use `{manynet}` or `{migraph}` tutorials
right out of the box:

```{r learnr-tutes}
run_tute()
# run_tute("tutorial1")
```

## Installation

### Stable

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `{manynet}` is via CRAN.

## Relationship to other packages

This package stands on the shoulders of several incredible packages.

In terms of the objects it works with,
this package aims to provide an updated, more comprehensive replacement for `{intergraph}`.
As such it works with objects in `{igraph}` and `{network}` formats,
but also equally well with base matrices and edgelists (data frames), 
and formats from several other packages.

The user interface is inspired in some ways by Thomas Lin Pedersen's excellent `{tidygraph}` package,
though makes some different decisions,
and uses the quickest `{igraph}` or `{network}` routines where available.

`{manynet}` has inherited most of its core functionality from its maternal package, `{migraph}`.
`{migraph}` continues to offer more analytic and modelling functions that builds upon
the architecture provided by `{manynet}`.
For more, please check out `{migraph}` directly.
