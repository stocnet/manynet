# Tutorials overview ####

#' Open and extract code from tutorials
#' 
#' @description 
#'   These functions make it easy to use the tutorials
#'   in the `{manynet}` and `{migraph}` packages:
#'   
#'   - `run_tute()` runs a `{learnr}` tutorial from 
#'   either the `{manynet}` or `{migraph}` packages,
#'   wraps `learnr::run_tutorial()` with some convenience.
#'   - `extract_tute()` extracts and opens just the solution code
#'   from a `{manynet}` or `{migraph}` tutorial,
#'   saving the .R script to the current working directory.
#'   
#' @param tute String, name of the tutorial (e.g. "tutorial2").
#' @importFrom dplyr %>% as_tibble select tibble
