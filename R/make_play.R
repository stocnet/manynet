# Diffusions ####

#' Making diffusion models on networks
#' @description
#' These functions simulate diffusion or compartment models upon a network.
#' 
#' - `play_diffusion()` runs a single simulation of a compartment model,
#' allowing the results to be visualised and examined.
# #' - `play_diffusions()` runs multiple simulations of a compartment model
# #' for more robust inference.
#' 
#' These functions allow both a full range of compartment models,
#' as well as simplex and complex diffusion to be simulated upon a network.
#' 
#' @section Simple and complex diffusion: 
#' 
#' By default, the function will simulate a simple diffusion process in
#' which some infectious disease or idea diffuses from seeds through
#' contacts at some constant rate (`transmissibility`).
#' 
#' These `seeds` can be specified by a vector index 
#' (the number of the position of each node in the network that should serve as a seed) 
#' or as a logical vector where TRUE is interpreted as already infected.
#' 
#' `thresholds` can be set such that adoption/infection requires more than one
#' (the default) contact already being infected.
#' This parameter also accepts a vector so that thresholds can vary.
#' 
#' Complex diffusion is where the `thresholds` are defined less than one.
#' In this case, the thresholds are interpreted as proportional.
#' That is, the threshold to adoption/infection is defined by the
#' proportion of the node's contacts infected.
#' 
#' Nodes that cannot be infected can be indicated as `immune`
#' with a logical vector or index, similar to how `seeds` are identified.
#' Note that `immune` nodes are interpreted internally as Recovered (R)
#' and are thus subject to `waning` (see below).
#' @section Compartment models: 
#' 
#' Compartment models are flexible models of diffusion or contagion,
#' where nodes are compartmentalised into one of two or more categories.
#' 
#' The most basic model is the SI model.
#' The SI model is the default in `play_diffusion()`/`play_diffusions()`,
#' where nodes can only move from the Susceptible (S) category to the
#' Infected (I) category.
#' Whether nodes move from S to I depends on whether they are exposed
#' to the infection, for instance through a contact,
#' the `transmissibility` of the disease,
#' and their `thresholds` to the disease.
#' 
#' Another common model is the SIR model.
#' Here nodes move from S to I, as above, but additionally they can
#' move from I to a Recovered (R) status.
#' The probability that an infected node recovers at a timepoint
#' is controlled by the `recovery` parameter.
#' 
#' The next most common models are the SIS and SIRS models.
#' Here nodes move from S to I or additionally to R, as above, 
#' but additionally they can move from I or R back to a Susceptible (S) state.
#' This probability is governed by the `waning` parameter.
#' Where `recover > 0` and `waning = 1`, the Recovery (R) state will be skipped
#' and the node will return immediately to the Susceptible (S) compartment.
#' 
#' Lastly, these functions also offer the possibility of specifying
#' a latency period in which nodes have been infected but are not yet infectious.
#' Where `latency > 0`, an additional Exposed (E) compartment is introduced
#' that governs the probability that a node moves from this E compartment
#' to infectiousness (I).
#' This can be used in in SEI, SEIS, SEIR, and SEIRS models.
#' @inheritParams mark_is
#' @param seeds A valid mark vector the length of the
#'   number of nodes in the network.
#' @param contact A matrix or network that replaces ".data" with some 
#'   other explicit contact network, e.g.
#'   `create_components(.data, membership = node_in_structural(.data))`.
#'   Can be of arbitrary complexity, but must of the same dimensions
#'   as .data.
#' @param thresholds A numeric vector indicating the thresholds
#'   each node has. By default 1.
#'   A single number means a generic threshold;
#'   for thresholds that vary among the population please use a vector
#'   the length of the number of nodes in the network.
#'   If 1 or larger, the threshold is interpreted as a simple count
#'   of the number of contacts/exposures sufficient for infection.
#'   If less than 1, the threshold is interpreted as complex,
#'   where the threshold concerns the proportion of contacts.
#' @param prevalence The proportion that global prevalence contributes
#'   to diffusion. 
#'   That is, if prevalence is 0.5, then the current number of infections
#'   is multiplied by 0.5 and added 
#'   "prevalence" is 0 by default, i.e. there is no global mechanism.
#'   Note that this is endogenously defined and is updated 
#'   at the outset of each step.
#' @param transmissibility The transmission rate probability,
#'   \eqn{\beta}.
#'   By default 1, which means any node for which the threshold is met
#'   or exceeded will become infected.
#'   Anything lower means a correspondingly lower probability of adoption,
#'   even when the threshold is met or exceeded.
#' @param recovery The probability those who are infected
#'   recover, \eqn{\gamma}.
#'   For example, if infected individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to recover, then \eqn{\gamma = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means there is no recovery (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in an SIR model.
#' @param latency The inverse probability those who have been exposed
#'   become infectious (infected), \eqn{\sigma} or \eqn{\kappa}.
#'   For example, if exposed individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to become infectious, then \eqn{\sigma = 0.75} (1/1-0.75 = 1/0.25 = 4).
#'   By default 0, which means those exposed become immediately infectious (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SEI model.
#' @param waning The probability those who are recovered 
#'   become susceptible again, \eqn{\xi}.
#'   For example, if recovered individuals take, on average,
#'   four days to lose their immunity, then \eqn{\xi = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means any recovered individuals retain lifelong immunity (i.e. an SIR model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SIRS model.
#'   \eqn{\xi = 1} would mean there is no period of immunity, e.g. an SIS model.
#' @param fatality The probability those who are infected
#'   are removed from the network, \eqn{\alpha}.
#'   Note that fatality is distinct from a natural mortality rate.
#'   By default \eqn{\alpha = 0}, which means that there is no fatality.
#'   Where \eqn{\alpha > 0}, the nodal attribute 'active' will be
#'   added if it is not already present.
#' @param immune A logical or numeric vector identifying nodes
#'   that begin the diffusion process as already recovered.
#'   This could be interpreted as those who are vaccinated or equivalent.
#'   Note however that a waning parameter will affect these nodes too.
#'   By default NULL, indicating that no nodes begin immune.
#' @param steps The number of steps forward in the diffusion to play.
#'   By default the number of nodes in the network.
#'   If `steps = Inf` then the diffusion process will continue until
#'   there are no new infections or all nodes are infected.
