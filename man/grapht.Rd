\usage{
grapht(
  tlist,
  layout,
  labels = TRUE,
  node_color,
  node_shape,
  node_size,
  edge_color,
  edge_size,
  keep_isolates = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tlist}{The same migraph-compatible network listed according to
a time attribute, waves, or slices.}

\item{keep_isolates}{Logical, whether to keep isolate nodes in the graph.
TRUE by default.
If FALSE, removes nodes from each frame they are isolated in.}
}
\value{
Shows a .gif image. Assigning the result of the function
saves the gif to a temporary folder and the object holds the path to this file.
}
\description{
This function provides users with an easy way to graph
dynamic network data for exploration and presentation.

It builds upon this package's \code{autographr()} function,
and inherits all the same features and arguments.
See \code{autographr()} for more.
However, it uses the \code{{gganimate}} package to animate the changes
between successive iterations of a network.
This is useful for networks in which the ties and/or the node or tie
attributes are changing.

A progress bar is shown if it takes some time to encoding all the
.png files into a .gif.
