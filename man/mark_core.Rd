\usage{
node_is_universal(.data)

node_is_core(.data, method = c("degree", "eigenvector"))

node_kcoreness(.data)

node_coreness(.data)

node_in_core(.data, groups = 3, cluster_by = c("bins", "quantiles", "kmeans"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An object of a manynet-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix (adjacency or incidence) from \code{{base}} R
\item edgelist, a data frame from \code{{base}} R or tibble from \code{{tibble}}
\item igraph, from the \code{{igraph}} package
\item network, from the \code{{network}} package
\item tbl_graph, from the \code{{tidygraph}} package
}}

\item{method}{Which method to use to identify cores and periphery.
By default this is "degree",
which relies on the heuristic that high degree nodes are more likely to be in the core.
An alternative is "eigenvector", which instead begins with high eigenvector nodes.
Other methods, such as a genetic algorithm, CONCOR, and Rombach-Porter,
can be added if there is interest.}

\item{groups}{Number of categories to create. Must be at least 2 and at most
the number of nodes in the network. Default is 3.}

\item{cluster_by}{Method to use to create the categories.
One of "bins" (equal-width bins), "quantiles" (quantile-based bins),
or "kmeans" (k-means clustering). Default is "bins".}
}
\description{
These functions identify nodes belonging to (some level of) the core of a network:
\itemize{
\item \code{node_is_universal()} identifies whether nodes are adjacent to all other
nodes in the network.
\item \code{node_is_core()} identifies whether nodes belong to the core of the
network, as opposed to the periphery.
\item \code{node_in_core()} categorizes nodes into two or more core/periphery
categories based on their coreness.
\item \code{node_coreness()} returns a continuous measure of how closely each node
resembles a typical core node.
\item \code{node_kcoreness()} assigns nodes to their level of k-coreness.
}
}
\section{Universal/dominating node}{

A universal node is adjacent to all other nodes in the network.
It is also sometimes called the dominating vertex because it represents
a one-element dominating set.
A network with a universal node is called a cone, and its universal node
is called the apex of the cone.
A classic example of a cone is a star graph,
but friendship, wheel, and threshold graphs are also cones.
}

\section{Core-periphery}{

This function is used to identify which nodes should belong to the core,
and which to the periphery.
It seeks to minimize the following quantity:
\deqn{Z(S_1) = \sum_{(i<j)\in S_1} \textbf{I}_{\{A_{ij}=0\}} + \sum_{(i<j)\notin S_1} \textbf{I}_{\{A_{ij}=1\}}}
where nodes \eqn{\{i,j,...,n\}} are ordered in descending degree,
\eqn{A} is the adjacency matrix,
and the indicator function is 1 if the predicate is true or 0 otherwise.
Note that minimising this quantity maximises density in the core block
and minimises density in the periphery block;
it ignores ties between these blocks.
}

\section{Core-periphery categories}{

This function categorizes nodes based on their coreness into a specified
number of groups. The groups are labeled as "Core", "Semi-core",
"Semi-periphery", and "Periphery" depending on the number of groups
specified.
The categorization can be done using different methods: equal-width bins,
quantile-based bins, or k-means clustering.
