\description{
Love Actually is a 2003 British romantic comedy film.
David Robinson's data is a two-mode network of 20 characters and their
appearances across 76 scenes, as parsed from the script.

Added to this are multiplex, one-mode networks of character relationships,
including "romantic", "family", "friendship", and "professional" ties.
These were added by Korakot Janteerasakul from the following source:
